The final collection of query complexities for learning cross products is given in Figure \ref{complexitytable}.
All of the bounds are tight, except for learning with superset queries, membership queries, and one positive example.  
Additionally, learning disjoint unions from any $Q \in \{ \{\eqQ\}, \{\subQ\}, \{\supQ\}\}$ requires as many queries as is needed to learn each concept separately,

\caption{
Final collection of query complexities for learning cross products. 
The rows represents the set $Q$ of queries needed to learn each $C_i$.  
The columns determine whether the cross product is learned from queries in just $Q$ or $Q \cup \{\memQ, \oneposQ\}$. 
In the latter case, the column is separated to track the number of membership queries and queries in $Q$ that are needed.
